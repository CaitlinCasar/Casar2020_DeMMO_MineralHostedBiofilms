- fluid geochemistry 
- mineral cell density 
- fluid cell density 

## fluid, mineral, and inert control community data

- sequenced at Argonne National Laboratory
- processed using QIIME and R 

## fluid geochemistry 

- log activity calculated with SpecE8 package in Geochemist Workbench

- logK calculated with SUPCRT function in CHNOSZ (see DeMMO_thermo_all.R)
- Energy density calculated in R (see DeMMO_thermo_all.R)

## mineral cell density 

- cell density estimates from cell counts on SEM .tif files 

## fluid cell density 

- cell density estimates from cell counts on fluorescence scope
